Back in January 2019, I [created the Null company](/bref-is-backed-by-null/). My goal: help developers work better, through products, training and consulting. My secondary goal: make some of that work open-source.

Last year, I was able to work on [Bref](https://bref.sh/) and its documentation, various [open-source projects](https://github.com/mnapoli), articles [in this blog](/), the [serverless PHP newsletter](https://serverless-php.news/), as well as share through [conferences, meetups](/presentations/) and podcasts (a first for me!).

That was awesome! Now I want to look back at 2019 and see how I am doing with funding that open-source work.

## Open source funding

Of all the revenue earned by [Null](https://null.tc/), here is the breakdown for 2019:

![](/images/posts/2019-open-source-funding.png)

##### Development services

Most of the revenue was related to development services, aka freelance work and code audits.

##### Serverless services

Next, I have a specific category for serverless-related services. That includes:

- serverless consulting
- training ([hint hint](https://training.bref.sh/))
- serverless or Bref support

I separate this category from the first because **this is a category I want to grow**. I am happy with this result for the first year, especially since it is growing a lot lately. As of March 2020, I have already surpassed 2019 for this specific category.

##### Open source work

Okay, here we are:

> In 2019, Null earned around 2000‚Ç¨ directly related to open-source work.

Needless to say, it is a small share of the total revenue. After taxes and company expenses, that would roughly be equivalent to 750‚Ç¨ as net income for me.

That year, I spent around 50 days working on open-source (conference talks not included). I also hired a friend to work on Bref for a total of 10 days. While 2000‚Ç¨ is probably most than most open-source developers, it would not cover 60 days of work.

That revenue comes from different sources:

- [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/)
- more recently: [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mnapoli)

And finally, [bref/symfony-messenger-sqs](https://github.com/brefphp/symfony-messenger-sqs) should have been my first open-source package whose development was paid by a company. However that bill was never paid. Ironic that my only unpaid bill is for open-source work ;)

Obviously, this is a category of revenue that I want to grow as well. In 2020, I can already see the trend improving as I am finding more sponsors. I still expect most of the open-source work to be paid for by other activities (i.e. sponsored by Null).

## 2020 goals

2020 started pretty strong: more open-source sponsors, brand new services finding their first clients (ü§´), a growing interest in serverless‚Ä¶ The future looks bright!

As for the goals:

- increase the "serverless services" category, because I love working with it: this is a technology that can transform, for the better, how we work
- work even more on open-source, which means finding more sponsors (thanks [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/) and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for leading the way!) and trying out new formats like [sponsorware](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware)
    - as a side goal, I aim to sponsor or hire other developers to work on open-source eventually
    - want to help? your company [can become a sponsor in a few clicks](https://github.com/sponsors/mnapoli) ‚ù§Ô∏è
- create paid products: this is new for me, and it could help a lot to fund the open-source work, stay tuned‚Ä¶

There is so much more to say about open-source funding. But I would rather publish that article as it is than store it somewhere and never finish it.

See you next year!
