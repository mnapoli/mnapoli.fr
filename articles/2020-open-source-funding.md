Back in January 2019, I [created the Null company](https://null.tc/). My goal: help developers work better, through products, training and consulting. My secondary goal: make some of that work open-source.

Just like [my financial report for 2019](2019-open-source-funding/), here's my yearly update for 2020 on **funding open-source work**.

## Open source funding

Of all the revenue earned by [Null](https://null.tc/), here is the breakdown for 2020:

When I compare that with 2019, I am really happy to have grown the "open-source work" and "products" parts:

#### Development services

Most of the revenue is still related to development services, i.e. freelancing and consulting.

#### Serverless services

I have a specific category for [serverless-related consulting](https://null.tc/) and training.

This year I launched [**Bref Enterprise**](https://bref.sh/#enterprise) and it has been working out quite well.

#### Products

In 2020, I launched 2 products:

- [**Serverless Visually Explained**](https://serverless-visually-explained.com/), an online course for serverless
- [**7777**](https://port7777.com/), a utility to connect easily to AWS RDS databases, built with [Marco](https://blog.deleu.dev/)

I absolutely loved doing that, and I have more things planned for 2021 üöÄ

#### Open source work

Okay, here we are:

> In 2020, my company earned around 13600‚Ç¨ directly related to open-source work.

Last year, it was 2000‚Ç¨. It is still a small share of the total revenue (and consequently, the money I take home every month), but it is definitely growing!

After accounting for expenses and taxes, it represents about 430‚Ç¨/month net income. That is not close to a real salary, but it is no longer negligible.

Last year was a bit premature to draw any conclusion. But looking back now, I can say that even with a widely used open-source project and an active online presence, living _directly and only_ from open-source work (sponsoring) as an individual is extremely hard.

To be clear, I am more than happy with my situation. What I am getting at is more of a "warning" for others who aspire to live of open-source: don't expect to copy [Evan You](https://evanyou.me/) or [Caleb Porzio](https://github.com/calebporzio) easily.

## 2021 goals

I want to continue the current trend and accelerate it:

- continue working on open-source and grow the sponsoring ([want to help?](https://github.com/sponsors/mnapoli) ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- continue delivering products and services that make developers awesome at their jobs!

See you next year!
